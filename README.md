## Project Overview
This project is part of the Udacity Azure ML Nanodegree.


## Dataset
### Overview
*TODO*: Explain about the data you are using and where you got it from.

### Task
*TODO*: Explain the task you are going to be solving with this dataset and the features you will be using for it.

### Access
*TODO*: Explain how you are accessing the data in your workspace.


## Automated ML
### Overview
*TODO*: Give an overview of the `automl` settings and configuration you used for this experiment

### Results
*TODO*: What are the results you got with your automated ML model? What were the parameters of the model? How could you have improved it?

*TODO* Remeber to provide screenshots of the `RunDetails` widget as well as a screenshot of the best model trained with it's parameters.


## HyperDrive
### Overview
*TODO*: What kind of model did you choose for this experiment and why? Give an overview of the types of parameters and their ranges used for the hyperparameter search

### Results
*TODO*: What are the results you got with your model? What were the parameters of the model? How could you have improved it?

*TODO* Remeber to provide screenshots of the `RunDetails` widget as well as a screenshot of the best model trained with it's parameters.


## Model Deployment
*TODO*: Give an overview of the deployed model and instructions on how to query the endpoint with a sample input.


## Screen Recording
This screen recording shows the entire process of the application, including the following areas:
- A working model
- Demo of the deployed model
- Demo of a sample request sent to the endpoint and its response

[Here is the link to the screen recording (5 minutes).](https://www.dropbox.com/s/i6jcczzno9j6t6f/Udacity_ML-Engineer_with_MS-Azure_Project-03_Screen-Recording.mov?dl=0)
